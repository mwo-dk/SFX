# SFX

This repository contains a collection of projects/packages that can (for some) be convenient in day-to-day development. Each project adresses various simple aspects, and are in general totally unrelated, but might sit on top of one another. 

Programming languages are/will be:

* For .Net development, it will be F# and C#. Typically these a project in one language will sit on top of or wrap the other. The base implementation is done in whatever language was most feasible for the developer - of which there is actually only one.
* C/C++ is an old love child, so some might show up.
* Haskell is a new love child, so some might also show up.

## DotNet

* **ROP** is for Railway Oriented Programming, a term set by Scott Wlashin. For details, see [the readme](doc/DotNet/README.ROP.md)
* **Utils** a set of basic helper routines for ie application development. For details, see [the readme](doc/DotNet/README.Utils.md)
* **EventAggregation** basic utilities to do in-process decoupled event aggregation. For details, see [the readme](doc/DotNet/README.EventAggregation.md)
* **Random** basic utilities to generate random data based on [RNGCryptoServiceProvider](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/security/cryptography/rngcryptoserviceprovider.cs,d525bf7d9ca1d38a). For details, see [the readme](doc/DotNet/README.Random.md)
